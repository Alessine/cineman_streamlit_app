Zurich Movie Recommender
==============================

Purpose
---------
I love going to the theatre to watch a movie, especially on a rainy weekend (which is most weekends in Zurich...). But more often than not, I found myself not being able to choose a movie out of all the ones being shown at any given time. Often I would end up just watching the most well-known big budget movie currently on, because I didn't want to spend time looking through the trailers of all the smaller alternative productions, but then I felt like I was missing out on too much of the diversity of movies available. Over the past few months, I built this movie recommender to solve this problem for me.

How it works
----------
This Streamlit app takes as an input the name of the user's favorite movie. It then compares the description for that movie (from tmdb) with the descriptions of all the movies that are currently running in Zurich. It recommends the most similar one and lists all the showtimes for the current date (scraped from cineman.ch).
